# 🌸 Flower Recognition Using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Flower Recognition System** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to classify flower images into different categories.  
The model learns visual features such as color, shape, and texture to accurately recognize flower types.
